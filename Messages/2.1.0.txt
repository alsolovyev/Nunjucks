Refactor:
 - moved context definitions into separate named blocks: `nunjucks-statement`,
   `nunjucks-expression`, and `nunjucks-comment`
 - added a new `prototype` context to include `nunjucks` package globally
 - simplified the `main` context with a single reference to `meta.template.njk`
 - updated statement, expression, and comment blocks to use individual includes for
   relevant Nunjucks elements
